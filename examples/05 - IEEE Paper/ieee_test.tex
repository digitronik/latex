\section{Travelling in absence of time}
Consider a cuboid is .

\end{figure}
Consider each marble ball as the space-time which is covering the space three dimentionally. Now watch the arrangement of the marbles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	Each ball 
\item	The balls 
\begin{figure}[htbp]

		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img2.png}
\end{figure}
\item	As the void is remaining as unoccupied space and one more thing one can move from one void to other because voide of time i.e. relative time.
\begin{itemize}
\item	This makes toesn't contain relative time.
\end{itemize}
\section{Theory supports existence of Black Hole}
``An elementary But even then mass and other calculations of black hole are done as:
$$ M^{~}(C^2/G)^{3/2}\rho^{-1/2} $$
Where,\\ $M =$ Mass
	$G =$ Gravity,
	$\rho =$ Density,
	$C =$ speed of light in vacuum.\\
	
time atom. \\
\begin{itemize}
\item 	Point supporting
\begin{itemize}
\item	The nearer 
\item	As the relative time \\

As relative time is zero. So,
$$ T=T'\, $$
\item	As there le be just a void so there may be possibility of transmitting of x-rays too.
\end{itemize}
\item	Contradictory points

\item	It doesn'
\item	Also ther

\begin{itemize}
\item	If we wil
\item	May be sul to light.

\section{Limitations}
Such voids are 

\section{Conclusion}
Such theories  must also be checked and to be taken as a new theory on the way of exploring wonders of the universe.
