### LaTeX

## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

## Why use LaTeX?

* LaTeX is free, multiplatform.
* LaTeX is just a text document (which can be opened by any text editor), readily converted to PDF.
* LaTeX separates content and style. Style once, then focus on content.
* The workflow is faster compared to MS Word.
* LaTeX is widely used for scientific topics.
* LaTeX is simply the best option when it comes to typesetting math expressions. You can add higher mathematic easily.
